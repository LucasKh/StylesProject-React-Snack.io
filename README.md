# Sample Snack app - Design using CSS (React.js)
This application mainly tackles styles and design where  we did implement the following: 
- This student app, can provide students with a much more convenient and simple way to register and login using their credentials.
- The new modern design makes it a joy to use for students, and helps to ensure cooperation with your schools security processes.
- Elements in react Native are styled using JavaScript. These style names and values are similar to those used in CSS.

# Conclusion and Future Work
More Features should be implemented in this app:
- Using SQLITE to allow more users to register instead of saving the users statically.
- Use firebase to improve the forget password feature.
- Adding more Categories to the app using sidebar Menu or Tabs.
- Adding a search feature to search for the course details.
